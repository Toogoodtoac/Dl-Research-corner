# Project Overview - Detailed

## Purpose and Scope

VBS-Web was developed as a comprehensive solution for visual content search and exploration. The project addresses the limitations of traditional text-based search by implementing multiple search modalities that cater to different user needs and search scenarios.

## Core Functionality

The application supports three primary search methods:

1. **Text-based Search**: Users can enter keywords or phrases to find images based on their associated metadata and descriptions. The search engine tokenizes the input query and matches it against image descriptions, tags, and other textual metadata.

2. **Visual Search**: This innovative feature allows users to create a visual query by arranging symbols on a canvas. The spatial relationships between these symbols are translated into search parameters, enabling users to find images with specific visual compositions or layouts.

3. **OCR-based Search**: The application can identify and index text that appears within images. Users can search for images containing specific text strings regardless of whether that text appears in the image metadata.

## Technical Implementation

Under the hood, the application consists of:

- A Next.js frontend that handles UI rendering and user interactions
- API routes that process search requests and communicate with backend services
- A service layer that abstracts the complexity of different search types

The application follows a client-server model where the frontend sends structured search queries to the backend, which processes these queries and returns relevant results. The search functionality is implemented using a combination of:

- Text similarity algorithms for keyword searches
- Visual feature extraction for image similarity
- OCR processing for text-in-image detection

## User Experience

The user interface is designed with a focus on:

- Simplicity: Clear search options and intuitive controls
- Flexibility: Multiple ways to construct and refine searches
- Responsiveness: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices

The application provides immediate feedback during search operations and presents results in a format that makes it easy to browse and explore related content.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of VBS-Web are:

1. To demonstrate the capabilities of modern web technologies in handling complex search operations
2. To provide a platform that can be extended with additional search modalities
3. To create an intuitive interface for exploring large image collections
4. To bridge the gap between text-based and visual-based search paradigms
